            "answer": "The signs of the condition include a spider web of veins, enlarged veins protruding above the skin, changes in skin color or texture, spider veins, heaviness or pain in the legs, and swelling at the end of the day. Many people don't see a doctor until they feel pain, but it's important to understand that pain is a sign of complications, such as thrombosis or phlebitis."
          },
          {
            "question": "How does a consultation with a phlebologist go?",
            "answer": "The doctor will listen to your complaints, take a medical history, and conduct an examination. Afterward, using ultrasound (Doppler ultrasound), the doctor will check the functioning of the valves, the presence of reflux, and accurately determine the affected vein segments. Based on a comprehensive examination, the doctor will make an accurate diagnosis, create an individual treatment plan, if necessary, select compression hosiery, and provide recommendations for disease prevention."
          },
          {
            "question": "What type of anesthesia is used during the surgery?",
            "answer": "The surgeries are performed under local tumescent anesthesia, which provides rapid and complete numbing of the procedure area. It's important to note that after this type of anesthesia, there are no intoxication effects on the body and no hematomas in the surrounding tissues. Interestingly, patients can leave the hospital just 1-2 hours after the surgery is completed."
          },
          {
            "question": "Can varicose veins be treated with ointments?",
            "answer": "Ointments do not treat varicose veins, they only partially relieve symptoms! Varicose veins are a chronic condition that can lead to serious complications if not treated properly, such as venous ulcers, thrombosis, or progressing venous insufficiency."
          },
          {
            "question": "I'm afraid to have surgery.",
            "answer": "Fear of surgery is a completely normal human reaction. However, it's important to manage that fear. Also, it's important to know that not in all cases, surgery is the only solution to your problem. The treatment method is determined by the doctor only after a full examination. It's also important to understand that varicose disease can lead to various complications and worsen the quality of the patient's life. Therefore, it's best to consult a doctor and treat the disease at an early stage."
          },
          {
            "question": "When is the best time to have surgery?",
            "answer": "When choosing the best date for surgery, I don't just look at the calendar, but also consider how the patient feels and how the disease is developing. Modern treatment is no longer limited by seasons. Surgeries can be performed at any time of the year."
          },
          {
            "question": "What complications can occur if varicose veins are not treated?",
            "answer": "Untreated varicose veins can lead to skin complications, ulcers, thrombophlebitis, worsening of venous insufficiency, and bleeding if treatment is delayed. It is recommended to seek medical attention at an early stage for diagnosis and treatment to avoid these complications."
          },
          {
            "question": "Do scars remain after the surgery?",
            "answer": "Considering the minimal access required to perform vein procedures, there are usually no significant scars left after the surgery. Modern phlebological procedures aim to minimize tissue trauma, resulting in minimal scarring. While early and uncomplicated cases of varicose veins are easier for patients to tolerate and offer better aesthetic results."

        "description": "(or foam sclerotherapy with ultrasound guidance) is a non-surgical method for treating varicose veins. The essence of this procedure involves the injection of a special sclerosing agent (typically in the form of a foam made of polidocanol) into the affected vein, often administered through intravenous catheters. This agent triggers inflammation within the vein, leading to its closure. As a result, blood can no longer flow through it, the vein's diameter decreases, and it eventually transforms into scar tissue.",
